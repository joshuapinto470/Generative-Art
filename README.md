## Getting Started
>This project is currently only developed using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 C++ Compiler.  
>You will need a CUDA capable device (If you have a NVIDIA GPU you should be fine)  
>Install [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#installing-cuda-development-tools)
to get started.

**Download the repository:**  
Start by cloning the repository with
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/joshuapinto470/Generative-Art.git`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

Now you should be able to build the project using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
